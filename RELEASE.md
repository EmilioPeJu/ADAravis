Release Notes
=============
### R2-0 (September 20, 2020)
----
* Updated from aravis 0.7.2 to 0.8.1.  The aravis API has changed, so sites will need to update their
  local aravis installation to 0.8.1.
* Fixed a problem with GenICam boolean features.  Previously the code was calling the aravis functions
  for integer features, which did not work.  It was changed to call the functions for boolean features,
  and it now works correctly.
* Removed ARHWImageMode. This was presumably used to support cameras that did not support
  the GenICam AcquisitionMode feature.  It seems all cameras now support that, and it
  was not tested that it actually worked.
* Changed printf() calls to asynPrint.  This required adding a new method.
* Added an example of adding the GenICam feature PV $(P)cam1:GC_Gamma to autosave in
  the iocAravis directory.  The auto_settings.req and st.cmd.BlackflyS_13Y3M files were changed.

### R1-3 (September 3, 2020)
----
* Add .bob files for Phoebus Display Manager
* This is the last release that will use ARAVIS_0_7_2.
  The next release will require ARAVIS_0_8_0 which was recently released.

### R1-2 (January 5, 2020)
----
* Change arvFeature support for GenICam features from int (32-bit) to epicsInt64 (64-bit)


### R1-1 (October 20, 2019)
----
* Added support for register caching
  * This improves the performance by over a factor of 100 when setting a feature, because ADGenICam reads
    all of the features when any feature was changed.
  * The constructor and aravisConfig have a new enableCaching argument to enable or disable register caching.
    It should be set to 1 except perhaps for some unusual cameras that do not correctly handle register caching.
* This release requires release ARAVIS_0_7_2 aravis package. ARAVIS_0_7_2 is described as an "unstable" release.  
  Note that more recent releases (e.g ARAVIS_0_7_3) **cannot** be used because the API has changed from ARAVIS_0_7_2.
  Hopefully there will be a stable 0.8.x release in the near future.  
  * This release of aravis adds support for register caching.
  * This release of aravis has changes to the aravis API for several functions.

### R1-0 (August 12, 2019)
----
* Initial release
